# Playing Around With JSON Documents And The X DevAPI In Lucee CFML And MySQL

by [Ben Nadel][bennadel]

I read that MySQL 8 included the ability to use MySQL as a Document Store (as opposed to the traditional relational database model). I just wanted to see what that might look like, especially since I couldn't hardly find a single example online for Java, let alone ColdFusion / CFML. This is just some experimentation and trial-and-error. Nothing in this application should be viewed as a well-thought-out practice.
